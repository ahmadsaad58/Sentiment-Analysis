    "The [dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) was compiled by Andrew Maas and had **50,000** movie reviews from IMDB. It is split into *25k* for training and *25k* for testing. The movie ratings on IMDB can range from 1 to 10. Movies with (less than or equal to) ≤ 4 stars are labeled as negative while movies with (greater than or equal to) ≥ 7 stars are labeled as positive. Reviews with 5 or 6 starts were left out of the dataset.\n",

      "yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller the story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happening fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesnt rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story\n"
