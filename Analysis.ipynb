    "\n",
    "The [dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) was compiled by Andrew Maas and had **50,000** movie reviews from IMDB. It is split into *25k* for training and *25k* for testing. The movie ratings on IMDB can range from 1 to 10. Movies with (less than or equal to) ≤ 4 stars are labeled as negative while movies with (greater than or equal to) ≥ 7 stars are labeled as positive. Reviews with 5 or 6 starts were left out of the dataset.\n",

      "Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as \"Teachers\". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is \"Teachers\". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched. What a pity that it isn't!\n"
